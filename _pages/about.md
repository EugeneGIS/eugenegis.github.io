Currently, I will finish my master's degree with a background in Geography & GIScience soon. In 2023.08, I will start my Ph.D. study at the Group of Cities and dynamics of networks ([CITADYNE Group](https://wp.unil.ch/citadyne-news/)), University of Lausanne, Switzerland, advised by Prof. [CÃ©line Rozenblat](https://applicationspub.unil.ch/interpub/noauth/php/Un/UnPers.php?PerNum=1048878&LanCode=8). 

Benefiting from the strict and effective training in China and Switzerland, my research interests and experience include, but are not limited to:
* **GIscience**: Spatial data science and visualization, including spatial analysis, spatial statistics, and machine learning.
* **Urban complexity**: Complex networks, Agent-based model, urban scaling and inequality.
* **Health geography**: Environmental health, health accessibility, and infectious diseases simulation.

With the goal of bridging the gap between theories and practical applications, I am focusing on the interaction among **complex urban systems**, **health geography**, **social networks**.
