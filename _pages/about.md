Currently, I will finish my master's degree with a background in Geography & GIScience soon. 

Benefiting from the strict and effective training in China and Switzerland, my research interests and experience include, but are not limited to:
* **GIscience**: Spatial data science and visualization, including spatial analysis, spatial statistics, and machine learning.
* **Urban complexity**: Complex networks, Agent-based model, urban scaling and inequality.
* **Health geography**: Environmental health, health accessibility, and simulation of Infectious diseases.

With the goal of bridging the gap between theory, algorithms, and practical applications, I am focusing on the interaction among **complex urban systems**, **health geography**, **social networks**.
