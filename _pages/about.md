Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at the Group of Cities and Dynamics of Networks ([CITADYNE Group](https://wp.unil.ch/citadyne-news/)), University of Lausanne, Switzerland, supervised by Prof. [CÃ©line Rozenblat](https://applicationspub.unil.ch/interpub/noauth/php/Un/UnPers.php?PerNum=1048878&LanCode=8). 

Benefiting from the strict and effective training in China and Switzerland, my research interests and experience include, but are not limited to:
* **Urban analytics**: Urban inequity & segregation, Healthy cities.
* **Health geography**: Epidemiology, Environmental health & inequalities.
* **Spatial data science**: Spatial analysis & visualization, and Machine learning.

Intending to bridge the gap between theories and practical applications, I am focusing on utilizing quantitative methods to explore intersections among urban geography, public health, network science, sociology, etc.
