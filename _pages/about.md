Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at the Group of Cities and Dynamics of Networks ([CITADYNE Group](https://wp.unil.ch/citadyne-news/)), University of Lausanne, Switzerland.

Benefiting from the strict and effective training in China and Switzerland, my research interests and experience include but are not limited to: 1) **Urban analytics**; 2) **Health geography**; 3) **Spatial data science**.

Following the framework "environment exposure - mobility behavior - human health" to bridge the gap between theories and practical applications, I am focusing on utilizing quantitative methods (e.g. complexity, networks, machine learning) to explore intersections between urban geography and public health.
