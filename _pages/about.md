Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at the Group of Cities and Dynamics of Networks ([CITADYNE Group](https://wp.unil.ch/citadyne-news/)), University of Lausanne, Switzerland.

Benefiting from the strict and effective training in China and Switzerland, my research interests and experience include but are not limited to: 1) **Health geography**; 2) **Spatial data science**; 3) **Urban analytics & complexity**.

Following the "complexity" theories and "exposome" framework, I am utilizing quantitative methods (e.g. networks, statistics, machine learning) to explore mechanisms between urban context and public health.
