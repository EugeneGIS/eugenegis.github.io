Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at the Group of Cities and dynamics of networks ([CITADYNE Group](https://wp.unil.ch/citadyne-news/)), University of Lausanne, Switzerland, supervised by Prof. [CÃ©line Rozenblat](https://applicationspub.unil.ch/interpub/noauth/php/Un/UnPers.php?PerNum=1048878&LanCode=8). 

Benefiting from the strict and effective training in China and Switzerland, my research interests and experience include, but are not limited to:
* **Urban analytics**: Urban sensing, urban systems, and related livability applications.
* **Health geography**: Environmental health, health accessibility, and health inequality.
* **Spatial data science**: Spatial analysis, spatial visualization, and machine learning.

With the goal of bridging the gap between theories and practical applications, I am focusing on the intersections among urban health, network science, activity space, and the Spatial-social-semantic framework.
