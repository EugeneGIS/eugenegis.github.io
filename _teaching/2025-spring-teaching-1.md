The spatial and temporal dimension characterizing the earth surface-environmental processes, together with the wealth of available data and the rapid development of analytical models, have become distinctive aspects of geospatial data analysis. This discipline encompasses data exploration, manipulation, and modelling, from the acquisition phase up to the visualization and interpretation of the results. Mapping where events are located and how they relate to each other provides a better understanding of the phenomena being studied. As an increasing volume of geo-environmental data becomes more and more accessible, the demand for experts in this field is growing rapidly, both in public research institutions and in private companies.

By the end of this course, students will gain a good understanding of the key practical concepts and R programming applications of geospatial data analysis, and will be able to master a range of techniques enabling them to analyze complex geo-environmental spatial datasets. These include but are not limited to: 

- exploratory data analyses and visualization of geographical variations in the statistical data distribution (Geographically Weighted Summary Statistics); 

- cluster detection and mapping (e.g. Ripley’s K-function, kernel density function, dbscan); 

- Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) as an example of unsupervised machine learning approach to data clustering and visualization;

- Random Forest (RF) as an example of a supervised machine learning algorithm, applied here for classification.
