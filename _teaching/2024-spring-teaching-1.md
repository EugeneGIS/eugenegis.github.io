The BIP Healthy Urban Systems provides systemic concepts, practical tools, and detailed illustration of health as the pulse of the new urban agenda, which will serve for different students at bachelor, master, PhD levels. 

The program will consist of training a group of students who will follow:

- The MOOC Healthy Urban Systems – UNIL/ Coursera (12 weeks)

- A final face-to-face training at the University of Lausanne for an application on a case study with interaction with local stakeholders (1 week). This face-to-face training will replace the folder that is required for the basic validation of the MOOC. They will be able to obtain the 6 modules provided by UNIL.
