Geographical networks offer a dynamic framework for understanding the complex spatial relationships that shape our world. In this course, students explore the theoretical foundations and critically assess practical techniques essential for analyzing, visualizing, and simulating geographical networks. By integrating various tools such as R, GEPHI, and NETLOGO, participants will not only develop robust analytical skills but also learn to effectively communicate their findings through compelling visualizations and presentations.

These include but are not limited to: 

- Networks organization and visualization;
  
- Networks structural indices; 

- Communities detection; 

- Correlation between networks;

- Explanatory analysis of networks;

- Simulations of networks.
