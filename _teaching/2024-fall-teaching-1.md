In this four-week, hands-on course, we will combine tutorials and guided exercises to introduce basic programming skills in Python to help you kickstart your own research projects. By the end of this course, you will know:

- Which Python libraries are most suitable for your application of interest and how to quickly look up documentation,

- How to handle data in multiple formats (from text files to gridded spatial data via time series), manipulate them mathematically/statistically, and visualize them efficiently for scientific analysis and communication.
