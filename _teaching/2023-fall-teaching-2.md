In this course, our objectives are to introduce systems approaches in geography and the sciences, exploring the theoretical models underpinning complex systems. We aim to foster a multi-dimensional, multi-level perspective in addressing territorial issues and showcase the benefits and challenges of collaborative approaches. Additionally, we'll encourage students to contemplate the role of systems thinking and artificial intelligence in territorial management and decision-making.
