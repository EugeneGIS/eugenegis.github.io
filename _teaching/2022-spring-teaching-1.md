This course aims to enable course participants to conduct a participatory Food System Sustainability Assessment. It builds on the Food System Sustainability Assessment Framework (FoodSAF). Participants will analyse the sustainability of a food system of a local product in Switzerland by using the FoodSAF tool. The course is conducted with the flipped classroom concept and consists of self-learning course component (out-of-class phase), exercises in classroom (in-class phase) and individual fieldwork with interviews. This course has been developed in collaboration with universities in Kenya, Nigeria, Bolivia and Columbia, but each country is focusing on its own local food systems. 

The Sustainable Food Systems course has been developed in the context of the Virtual Food Sustainability Academy (VFSA), a Transformation Accelerating Grant (Nr. 201205) of the Swiss Programme for Research on Global Issues for Development funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC).
