In this 12-week hands-on course, we will introduce common machine learning and deep learning algorithms in the context of their application in Earth and environmental sciences. By the end of this course, you should be able to:

- Identify common algorithms and summarize their advantages and limitations, especially in the context of environmental science,

- Implement them in Python (mostly using the Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Tensorflow libraries in Google Collab notebooks),

- Know from experience which algorithms are most appropriate for environmental applications you are passionate about (e.g., your thesis and further research).
